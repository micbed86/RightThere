## ‚ú® Key Features

### Advanced Inputs & Context

* **Image & Vision Support:** Attach images directly to your chat! Interact with multi-modal vision models to analyze, describe, or ask questions about visual content.

* **Full Chat Interface:** Engage in multi-turn conversations, regenerate responses, and maintain a seamless dialogue with the AI.
* **Model Freedom:** Natively integrated with **OpenRouter.ai**, giving you access to a massive and ever-growing list of models from different providers.
* **Drag & Drop Organization:** Effortlessly reorder your prompts and folders with a simple drag-and-drop interface in the settings.

### Elegant & Customizable UI

* **Instant Access:** Summon the AI panel anytime with a customizable keyboard shortcut (default: `Alt + Q`).
* **Draggable & Resizable Glass UI:** A beautiful, semi-transparent glassmorphism interface that you can move and resize to fit your workflow without being intrusive.
* **Deeply Customizable:**
  * **Themes:** Switch between a polished Light and a sleek Dark mode.
  * **Skin Tinting:** Personalize the panel's color and opacity to perfectly match your aesthetic.
  * **Persistent Width:** The panel remembers its width across sessions if you want it to.

### Seamless Workflow Integration

* **Copy & Replace:** Instantly copy the AI's response to your clipboard or directly replace your selected text with the AI-generated content in any editable field.
